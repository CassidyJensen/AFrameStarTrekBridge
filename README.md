## Notes

I avoided putting a ceiling on because I felt one of the best features was staring up at the stars. 

Additionally, although I included physics I did not make any of the objects in the scene static-body except for the floor. This is due to a bug where the camera started to slowly get pushed below the floor. I was unable to find the source of this error.
